More For Loops:
1. intialize variables to be used in for loops.
2. construct for loop for odd numbers using increments
of 2 starting at 1. 
3. construct for loop for even numbers using increments
of 2 starting at 0. 
4. initialize string of same characters as original
word. Use for loop to replace those characters with
the original words starting from the last index position.
5. for loop with start at 1, end at input, increments of 
1.
6. for loop starts at input, ends at 1, decrements of 1.
Print all iterations and the product of them.
